# Overview

In the wake of the U.S. men's national soccer team failing to [qualify](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2017/10/10/in-a-stunner-u-s-falls-to-trinidad-and-tobago-and-will-not-qualify-for-2018-world-cup/?utm_term=.a5877dd1a765) for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, an unimaginable series of events left supporters, former players, and members of the media trying to make sense of it all. Some responses were [measured](http://www.espnfc.com/team/united-states/660/blog/post/3227056/why-the-us-failed-to-qualify-for-2018-world-cup-in-russia)—others [impassioned](http://www.espnfc.com/world-cup-qualifying-concacaf/64/video/3226307), delivered in the heat of the moment. But most shared a common thread: frustration with the country's youth development system. 

More specifically, there emerged a collective assault on "[pay-to-play](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/01/us-soccer-diversity-problem-world-football)," a structure which, some argue, limits access for low-income children of color to high-quality, competitive soccer. Building off that argument, I decided to study two lesser-discussed, yet closely related, pieces of the puzzle: location and exposure.

A Washington, D.C.-area resident, I decided to limit my sample to this area. The clubs participating in the National Capital Soccer League's Fall 2017 season set the geographic limits of my study (D.C. and the surrounding counties in northern Virginia, southern Maryland, and eastern West Virginia). Based on this information, I collected field addresses to calculate the mean location of each club, and I collected race and poverty data for each census tract in the region from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) (ACS).

Most notably, the opportunities to play competitive soccer for children in mostly nonwhite neighborhoods are few and far between. When plotting the points on the map (see the **Race** section in the .Rmd file), a 20-plus-mile-wide hole opened up in the area southeast of D.C., where a majority of the census tracts in which the share of nonwhite residents is 60 percent or greater. And out of the 380 soccer fields in the sample, less than 15 percent are located in majority-minority census tracts. (For reference, out of the 1,600 census tracts in the sample, 32 percent are majority-minority.)

Socioeconomic diversity (by way of poverty rates) also played a role, though less prominent. Out of the 380 soccer fields in the sample, *just one* is located in a census tract with a poverty rate greater than 20 percent. (For reference, out of the 1,600 census tracts in the sample, 15 percent have poverty rates greater than 20 percent.)

I did attempt a handful of different regression techniques in an attempt to explain causality within the sample. But the shape of the data (only 177 of the 1,600 census tracts contained at least one field) prevented both the nonwhite share and poverty rate of a census tract from being accurate or reliable predictors of the presence of a soccer field on which competitive games are played.

While no conclusions about the state of U.S. youth soccer should be drawn from this study, it does reveal some interesting, albeit alarming, trends within the region of our nation's capital. 

This is not to say that children growing up in these underserved areas are stripped of *all* opportunities to enjoy the beautiful game. Organizations like [DC SCORES](https://www.dcscores.org/) and the [U.S. Soccer Foundation](https://ussoccerfoundation.org/programs/safe-places-to-play) work to ensure that they are not completely excluded. But if the stated goal of the soccer community is to develop a more racially and socioeconomically diverse pipeline through the ranks of our senior U.S. national teams, these findings may suggest that there's still work to be done.
